# Grok Imagine – Bulk Favorites Downloader

A Tampermonkey userscript that bulk-downloads all of your saved/favorited images and videos from [grok.com/imagine](https://grok.com/imagine). It remembers what it has already downloaded so future runs only grab new ones.

---

## Step 1 — Install Tampermonkey

First, install the Tampermonkey browser extension if you haven't already:

- **Chrome** → [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- **Firefox** → [Install from Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- **Edge** → [Install from Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
- **Safari** → [Install from App Store](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari)

---

## Step 2 — Configure Tampermonkey (Do This Before Installing the Script)

After installing Tampermonkey, you need to enable two settings or the script will not work.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your address bar
2. Find **Tampermonkey** and click **Details**
3. Scroll down and turn on **"Allow User Scripts"**

> This allows Tampermonkey to run scripts that have not been reviewed by Google. You should only enable this if you trust the script you are installing.

4. On the same page, also turn on **"Allow in Incognito"** if you want the script to work in private/incognito windows

> Without this the script will only run in normal browser windows.

Once both settings are enabled, proceed to installation below.

## Features

- **Bulk downloads all favorites** — no limit, grabs everything
- **Smart early stopping** — since Grok returns favorites newest-first, stops paginating as soon as it hits a full page of already-downloaded items
- **Chunked downloading** — downloads in batches of 200, pausing between each so your browser doesn't get overwhelmed
- **Download history** — remembers every downloaded file by ID so repeat runs only fetch new favorites
- **Media type filter** — choose to download images only, videos only, or both
- **Page limit option** — optionally limit how many pages to fetch (each page = 40 items) so you don't have to download everything
- **Save IDs only mode** — mark your current favorites as "already have" without downloading any files
- **Re-download everything mode** — ignore history and grab everything fresh
- **No page interference** — uses `GM_xmlhttpRequest` so Grok's own page loads normally
- **Works with images and videos** — downloads `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, and `.mp4` files
- **Smart filenames** — files are named `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_ID_model_prompt.ext` so they're easy to sort and search
- **Persistent history** — download history survives page reloads and browser restarts via Tampermonkey storage

## Requirements

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- A [grok.com](https://grok.com) account with saved favorites

---

## Step 3 — Installation

1. Click the downloaded `grok-imagine-bulk-favorites-downloader-v14.user.js` file — Tampermonkey should automatically prompt you to install it
2. Alternatively, open the Tampermonkey dashboard → click **Create new script** → paste the entire script contents → save

## How to Use

1. Go to **[grok.com/imagine/favorites](https://grok.com/imagine/favorites)**
2. Make sure the page has fully loaded
3. You'll see a **"⬇ Download New Favorites"** button in the bottom-right corner of the page
4. Click it — a modal will appear asking what you'd like to do

### Modal Options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **⬇ Download new favorites** | Fetches all favorites, skips ones already downloaded, downloads the rest in chunks of 200 |
| **🔖 Save IDs only (no download)** | Marks all current favorites as "already have" without downloading any files |
| **⬇ Download everything (ignore history)** | Re-downloads all favorites regardless of history |

### Modal Settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Max pages to fetch** | Leave blank for unlimited, or type a number to stop after that many pages (1 page = 40 items) |
| **Media type** | Choose Images & Videos, Images only, or Videos only |

5. Files are saved to your browser's default **Downloads** folder under a `grok-favorites/` subfolder

> **Tip:** Disable "Ask where to save each file" in your browser's download settings, otherwise you'll get a save dialog for every single file.

## How It Works

### API Approach
Rather than trying to scroll the page and scrape visible images (which doesn't work because Grok uses a virtualized grid that only renders ~10 cards at a time), the script directly calls Grok's internal REST API:

```
POST https://grok.com/rest/media/post/list
Body: { limit: 40, filter: { source: "MEDIA_POST_SOURCE_LIKED" }, cursor: "..." }
```

This is the same endpoint Grok's own website uses to load your favorites. Because the script runs inside your logged-in browser session, your session cookies are sent automatically — no API key or login needed.

### Pagination
The API returns 40 items per page along with a `nextCursor` token. The script keeps calling the API with the cursor from each response until no cursor is returned. Since Grok returns favorites newest-first, the script also stops early if it hits a full page where every item is already in your download history.

### Chunked Downloading
Once all favorites are collected, they are split into chunks of 200 and downloaded sequentially. After each chunk finishes being queued, the script pauses for 5 seconds to give the browser time to process the downloads before starting the next chunk.

### Download History
Every successfully queued file's ID is saved to Tampermonkey's persistent storage (`GM_setValue`). On future runs the script fetches the full favorites list from the API but filters out any IDs already in history before downloading. History is saved incrementally during downloading so if the browser crashes mid-run, already-queued files won't be re-downloaded next time.

### No Page Interference
The script uses `GM_xmlhttpRequest` which runs in Tampermonkey's own isolated context and cannot interfere with the page's own network requests.

## File Naming

Downloaded files are named using this format:

```
grok-favorites/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_XXXXXXXX_modelname_your-prompt-here.jpg
```

For example:
```
grok-favorites/2025-03-01_1430_a1b2c3d4_grok-2_a-cat-wearing-a-spacesuit.jpg
```

---

## Resetting Download History

If you want to re-download everything from scratch (e.g. you got a new computer, files were lost, or you just want a fresh start):

- Click the **"🗑 Reset download history"** link underneath the download button
- Confirm the prompt
- The next run will treat all favorites as new and download everything again

Alternatively, select **"⬇ Download everything (ignore history)"** from the modal for a one-time full re-download without permanently clearing the history.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Button doesn't appear**
Make sure "Allow User Scripts" is enabled in Tampermonkey's settings (see Step 1). Then refresh the page.

**Script not running on the page**
Go to `chrome://extensions` → Tampermonkey → Details and make sure "Allow User Scripts" is toggled on. Also try navigating directly to `https://grok.com/imagine/favorites` by typing it in the address bar rather than clicking through the site.

**"API request failed" error**
Make sure you are logged into grok.com. Try refreshing the page and clicking the button again.

**Only getting 0 items**
Refresh the page, wait for your favorites grid to fully load, then click the button.

**Downloads going to wrong folder**
The script saves to a `grok-favorites/` subfolder inside your browser's default downloads location. To change the base downloads location, update it in your browser settings.

**Want to check what's happening under the hood**
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab. The script logs everything prefixed with `[GrokDL]` including API responses, page counts, and any errors.

## Privacy

This script runs entirely inside your browser. It only communicates with `grok.com`, `assets.grok.com`, and `x.ai` to fetch your own media. No data is sent to any third-party server.
